# TODO
- Volleybomb - Have your Time Bomb get punched 10 times before it explodes.
- anvil projectile
  - lang stuff
  - spell (pos -> entity)
  - fix collision jank (especially if an entity is moving towards a stationary anvil)
- fix particles not working all the time?
- trident projectile
  - bounces when hitting surfaces at shallow angles
  - players can jump on it boing!!
  - if vertical then player is launched forwards instead of upwards
  - let it launch the anvil LOL

# Ideas
- Pigment Blocks (could just be a hexical pr)
- Mantra Purification ([pattern], pattern -> mantra) (on one hand its just a listiota wrapper on the other hand "Yet Another Hex Abbreviator" pun)
